### Technologies used
- React
- React Router Dom
- Firebase Auth
- Tailwind CSS
- Daisy UI
- Firestore
- Axios
- React Query
- React Hook Form

### Features
Users can login and register using email and password. When registering a user can upload his image. After registration user will be logged out and redirected to login page. A user can edit and delete users but viewers will not be able to edit or delete users. Tried to handle errors as mush as possible. 

Note: Though I've used firebase auth before, it is my first time using firestore.
